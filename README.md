# MultiOutputRegressor-SingleOutputRegressor
Multiple output regressor using Pyhton

	* Multioutput regression are regression problems that involve predicting two or more numerical values given an input example.

	* This assumes that the outputs are independent of each other. This approach can provide surprisingly effective predictions on a range of problems and may be worth trying, 
		at least as a performance baseline.
